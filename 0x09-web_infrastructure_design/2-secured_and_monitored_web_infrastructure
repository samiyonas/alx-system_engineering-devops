I added 1 more server for hign availability and firewall for extra security and used HTTPS for secure response of web pages and monitoring so I know how my software is doing.

The firewalls are for security and they only let packets based on preconfiguration.

So that the response page can be encrypted and can only be decrypted once it gets to where it should go.

Monitoring is used to know how your software is doing.

It will give me the queries per second

It reduces the security and puts more burden on CPU and memories of the laod balancer.

If it fails then we wouldn't be able to write on our database

Because all of them would be prone to the same type of error and if one server fails it's likely that the other one's will fail too.
