So I added one extra server and a load balancer and the reason I added the extra server is so that I won't have a single point of failure and the reason I added the load balancer is so that it will assign requests to both servers using it's algorithms fairly.

It is configured with weighted round robin and fastest algorithms and how it works is it will assign the requests based on the server's capability and it's response time so a server with high capability(e.g hardware capability) and fast response time will get assigned the incoming request.

My load balancer is enabling an Active-Active setup. So the difference between Active-Active load setup and Active-Pasive setup is that in Active-Active setup all servers are being used all the time and in Active-Passive setup some are being used all the time and some are kind of put to sleep and only when there is a problem with the active one they get awake and start accepting requests

Since we have two servers I don't think we have a single point of failure

Since I am not using any firewall software or HTTPS, the design is hignly vulnerable

No monitoring so I don't know how my software is doing, if there is anything to fix or not.
