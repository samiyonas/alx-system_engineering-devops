Server is a physical or a virtual machine that serves other programs or devices.

The role of domain name is to access website that is hosted on a web server which we don't know it's IP address and for this abstraction we use DNS(Domain Name System).

It is in a CNAME record.

The role of a web server is to accept web request through HTTPS and give response(web pages).

The role of an application server is to give dynamic web pages to the client(web server) and it communicates with databases to create real time dynamic web pages.

The role of a database is to store different information both structured and unstructured systematically so we can manipulate it.

HTTP

Since this design has only one server it has single point of failure

When maintenance is needed or a new code is being deployed the server will have a downtime and it has to be restarted

Since this design doesn't have more than one server and a load balancer it can not scale too much incoming traffic
