Postmortem: Service Outage on Web Stack

Issue Summary:

    Duration:
        Start Time: June 25, 2024, 10:00 PM
        End Time: June 25, 2024, 12:30 AM

    Impact:
        The primary web application was inaccessible to users.
        Users experienced HTTP 503 errors and slow response times.
        Approximately 70% of users were affected.

    Root Cause:
        The root cause was identified as a misconfigured load balancer that exceeded its capacity limits due to a recent spike in incoming traffic.

Timeline:

    10:00 AM:
        Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating high latency and increased error rates.
    10:15 AM:
        Engineers investigated server logs and load balancer metrics to determine the source of the issue.
    10:45 AM:
        Initial assumption was a database overload due to a recent deployment, leading to a misleading path of investigation.
    11:00 AM:
        Incident escalated to the DevOps team for further analysis and resolution.
    12:30 AM:
        The issue was resolved by reconfiguring the load balancer to handle the increased traffic and optimizing database queries.

Root Cause and Resolution:

    Root Cause:
        Misconfigured load balancer settings that did not scale appropriately under high traffic conditions.
    Resolution:
        Adjusted load balancer settings to increase capacity thresholds and implemented more granular monitoring to detect similar issues early.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

    Improvements:
        Implement automated scaling policies for load balancers based on traffic patterns.
        Enhance monitoring capabilities to include real-time alerts for load balancer performance metrics.
        Conduct regular load testing to simulate traffic spikes and ensure system readiness.
    Tasks to Address:
        Update load balancer configuration to optimize for peak traffic loads.
        Implement enhanced logging and monitoring for rapid detection of similar issues.
        Conduct a post-incident review to refine incident response procedures and improve team coordination.

This postmortem provides a concise overview of the outage, its impact, root cause analysis, resolution steps, and actionable tasks for improvement.
